Warning! Mixing Conda and module environments may lead to corruption of the
user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.
For more information, please refer to our software policy page:

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.

Building wheels for collected packages: flash-attn
  DEPRECATION: Building 'flash-attn' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'flash-attn'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334
